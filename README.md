These exclude the 9 apocalypse flasks m from the bosses and the health node inside the refill station.
One note and one apocalypse urn occur twice.
You can set each individual item to the place of another. To do that, open the Randomize menu in the toolbar, select a item and assign another one.
Continue until you set all your item.
After that you can take the decision to enter a seed and randomize all unset items as well.
If you don't want to randomize the other items just leave the seed field empty.
